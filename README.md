# Simple Portfolio Template

Welcome! This is a starter template for your personal portfolio website. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5** to give you a professional look that is easy to customize.

## 🚀 Getting Started with VS Code

The easiest way to work on this website is using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

### 1. Setup

1.  **Download & Install** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.
2.  **Download/Unzip** this portfolio folder to your computer.
3.  Open VS Code.
4.  Go to **File > Open Folder...** and select this portfolio folder.

### 2. Install Recommended Extensions

When you open this folder, VS Code might ask if you want to install "Recommended Extensions".

1.  Click **Install**.
2.  If it doesn't ask, click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (looks like squares).
3.  Type `@recommended` in the search bar.
4.  Install **Live Server**.

### 3. Run the Website

1.  Open `index.html` in VS Code.
2.  Look at the very bottom right corner of the VS Code window.
3.  Click the button that says **Go Live**.
4.  Your browser should automatically open showing your website!
    - _Note: Every time you save a file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S), the browser will automatically reload to show your changes._

## ✏️ How to Edit

### 1. Changing Text

Open `index.html` in VS Code. Look for the comments I've added, like this:

```html
<!-- EDIT YOUR NAME HERE -->
<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">My Name</a>
```

Simply delete "My Name" and type your own name. Save the file, and watch the browser update!

### 2. Changing Images

1.  Save your images (jpg or png) into the `images` folder.
2.  In `index.html`, find the image tags:
    ```html
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x225" ... />
    ```
3.  Change the `src` (source) to match your file name:
    ```html
    <img src="images/my-project-photo.jpg" ... />
    ```

### 3. Changing Colors & Styles

Open `css/styles.css`. This file controls the "look" of your site.

- You can change colors, fonts, and spacing here.
- I've included some examples in the file to help you get started.

## 📂 Understanding the Files

- `index.html`: The main page of your website. It contains all the structure and text.
- `css/styles.css`: The styling rules. It tells the browser how to make things look (colors, layout tweaks).
- `images/`: A folder to keep your pictures organized.
- `.vscode/`: Settings for the editor (you can ignore this).

- **Experiment.** Change numbers in the CSS or move tags around in the HTML to see what happens.
- **Google is your friend.** If you want to do something specific (like "how to center text css"), typing that into Google will usually give you the answer.
